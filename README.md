## Introduction

<p align="justify">
Human-mediated dispersal acts as a vector for many exotic species, both at the introduction and secondary spread stages. Primary and secondary introductions arise from human-mediated long distance dispersal happening at global scales. Secondary spread occurs at smaller spatial and time scales (*e.g.* landscape) and results from either natural or human-mediated dispersal. Despite the importance of materials transportation (*e.g.* landscaping, construction) for the spread of invasive species, few studies have investigated short distance human-mediated dispersal and even less have tried to model it.

<p align="justify">
**MoRIS** (Model of Routes of Invasive Spread) is a spatially explicit spread model designed to simulate invasive species dispersal by transport at local to regional spatial scales. **MoRIS** is an innovative, yet simple model, taking into account the road network topology to influence the direction of dispersal events. **MoRIS** is designed to minimize *a priori* making (*e.g.*, expert knowledge), to enable the estimation of human-mediated dispersal parameters based on a simple presence/absence locations dataset and to produce predictive maps of spread.
