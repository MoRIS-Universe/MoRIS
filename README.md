## Introduction

<p align="justify">
Human-mediated dispersal acts as a vector for many exotic species, both at the introduction and secondary spread stages. Primary and secondary introductions arise from human-mediated long distance dispersal happening at global scales. Secondary spread occurs at smaller spatial and time scales (<em>e.g.</em> landscape) and results from either natural or human-mediated dispersal. Despite the importance of materials transportation (<em>e.g.</em> landscaping, construction) for the spread of invasive species, few studies have investigated short distance human-mediated dispersal and even less have tried to model it.

<p align="justify">
  <strong>MoRIS</strong> (<em>Model of Routes of Invasive Spread</em>) is a spatially explicit spread model designed to simulate invasive species dispersal by transport at local to regional spatial scales. <strong>MoRIS</strong> is an innovative, yet simple model, taking into account the road network topology to influence the direction of dispersal events. <strong>MoRIS</strong> is designed to minimize <em>a priori</em> making (<em>e.g.</em>, expert knowledge), to enable the estimation of human-mediated dispersal parameters based on a simple presence/absence locations dataset and to produce predictive maps of spread.
